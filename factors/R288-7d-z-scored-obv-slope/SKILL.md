# 7D Z-Scored OBV Slope

Use this Skill to compute `7日标准化OBV斜率` / `7D Z-Scored OBV Slope` from caller-provided OHLCV data.

## Workflow

1. Load a `pandas.DataFrame` with `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`; include `date` and `symbol` for cross-sectional research.
2. Call `scripts/factor.py::compute_factor(df)` to compute the factor column.
3. Call `generate_signals(df)` for a simple rank-based long/short signal.
4. Review `validation_real/report.md` before using the factor in a model.

## Runtime Contract

- Framework-neutral Python: `pandas` and `numpy`.
- The caller owns data vendor, universe, calendar, costs, slippage, and execution modeling.
